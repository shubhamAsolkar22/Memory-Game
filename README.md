This repository basically contains a project that I completed as a part of my Udacity Nanodegree.The game consists of 16 cards which are inverted and we need to flip the cards to find out the picture behind the cards.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Memory Game project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `index.html` and start tickling your memory.


## Bugs
* Double clicking makes the card green - Resolved
